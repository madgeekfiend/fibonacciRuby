Fibonacci
====

The fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence to come up with the sum of the
number at that point. Given the first and second starting numbers of the sequence are 0 and 1. A sequence of numbers
are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13...

This program demonstrates how to do it in Ruby either recursively or iteratively. All the code in this program is original
work derived from reading how to make the calculation no copy and paste from existing internet code.
